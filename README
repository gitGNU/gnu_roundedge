This is the README file for roundedge

DESCRIPTION
roundedge is a little Qt4 eyecandy program that makes the edges of
your desktop round. It doesn't use composide but works as an overlay
so that you can still grab the window below.
For more details call roundedge with option '-help'.

TODO
At the current version it's not very well tested and lacks of a exit
function. It means you have to 'kill' it ;)

LICENSE
GPLv3 or any later

DEPENDENCIES
Qt version 4.5.2

HOW TO BUILD
first execute 'qmake' then 'make'

HOW TO INSTALL
copy the binary 'roundedge' to /usr/local/bin for example.
